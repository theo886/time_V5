# Database Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Azure SQL Database integration for the Weekly Percentage Tracker app. The integration allows for persistent storage of timesheet data across sessions and devices.

## Key Components

### 1. Database Configuration (`dbConfig.js`)
- Establishes a connection pool to the Azure SQL Database
- Uses environment variables from `.env` for secure credential storage
- Provides connection pooling for efficient database operations

### 2. Database Service (`dbService.js`)
- Creates the database schema if it doesn't exist
- Provides CRUD operations for timesheet entries:
  - `getTimeEntriesForUser` - Fetch all entries for a user
  - `getTimeEntryForWeek` - Fetch entries for a specific week
  - `saveTimeEntry` - Create or update entries for a week
  - `deleteTimeEntry` - Delete entries for a week

### 3. Server API Endpoints (Enhanced `server.js`)
- `/api/timeentries` (GET) - Fetch all timesheet entries
- `/api/timeentries/:weekKey` (GET) - Fetch entries for a specific week
- `/api/timeentries` (POST) - Save or update timesheet entries
- `/api/timeentries/:weekKey` (DELETE) - Delete timesheet entries

### 4. Front-end API Client (`apiClient.js`)
- Provides a client-side interface to communicate with the server API
- Handles error reporting and data formatting

### 5. Front-end Integration (`index.js`)
- Loads timesheet data from the database on startup
- Saves changes to the database when submitting timesheets
- Provides loading states and notifications during data operations
- Implements client-side caching for offline capabilities

## Data Flow
1. On application startup, the app fetches all timesheet entries from the database
2. When navigating between weeks, the app checks if data is available in the local cache first
3. If not available in cache, it fetches data from the database
4. When submitting a timesheet, the app saves to both the local cache and the database
5. Dashboard charts are generated using data from both sources

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly notifications
- Graceful fallbacks to empty states when database operations fail
- Connection pool management to prevent resource leaks

## Security Considerations
- Database credentials stored in environment variables
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- User identification based on email (authentication to be implemented in future)

## Testing Instructions
1. Ensure the `.env` file contains valid database credentials
2. Start the server with `node server.js`
3. Access the application at http://localhost:8080
4. Create and submit timesheet entries to test database storage
5. Navigate between weeks to test data loading
6. View the dashboard to ensure data is correctly displayed

## Next Steps
- Add user authentication
- Implement additional data validations
- Add data export functionality
- Create admin dashboard for viewing all user submissions
